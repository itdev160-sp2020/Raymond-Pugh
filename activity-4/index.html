                    I had black mold growing in my bathtub. I was really against buying anything with harsh chemicals, however, the other stuff wasn't removing it. I sprayed this all over my tub, shower tiles and grouted areas (this was the part of the shower that had the mold). I let this sit for 5 minutes and rinsed with hot water and BOOM! Shower is like-new again. I am super happy this worked and it's something I will use in the bathroom every so often. I also used this on my quartz countertop. We had some scratches and silver marks from where our keys were put down. I wasn't able to get these marks out but this removed those as well.

                    I sometimes use amazon grocery delivery when I'm in a pinch, though I typically like to go grocery shopping myself to pick out my food. However, when I do use amazon grocery, so far everything arrives fresh and in good order. These blueberries were nice and tasty. Arrived in good condition.

                    This is the coolest doll! All of her joints articulate (even her wrists) and she is very sturdily made. Her outfit metallic shiny fabric that is extremely detailed and very precisely sewn, and her mask is actually made to stick on her face with a non-messy adhesive design. Her face isn’t just painted on, she actually has realistic eyes that look awesome. My daughter loves this toy and takes it everywhere with her. I’m amazed that I could get her for such a good price, especially when none of my local stores carry any Violet dolls.

                        This garbage disposal requires that you use the sink drain trim piece attached to the disposal. It's made into the disposal assembly and cannot be removed. The trim is super shiny chrome with "WASTE KING" written all over it. It cannot be replaced with any trim that matches your sink and looks horrendously tacky. Most sinks are not chrome finish so it will not match and will only draw attention to the ugly trim piece since it is so shiny and has the brand stamped all over it. Returning before even installing.
